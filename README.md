# static-search-portal

**🧪 EXPERIMENTAL 🧪**

This is a working proof-of-concept of a Globus-powered research search portal `generator` created using Next.js.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️** You only need to interact with **this** repository if you are improving the `generator` or using this code to start a self-managed project. If you want to deploy a search portal, copy our [template-search-portal](https://github.com/globus/template-search-portal) and modify the `static.json` file to suit your needs.
